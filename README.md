# FED1 Project Exam 1

Project Focus
This project focused on APIs and JavaScript. My goal was to create reusable code blocks—write once and use them many times. Although my skills are not perfect yet, I plan to improve in this area.

Learning More About APIs
I want to learn more about APIs because I wasn’t completely satisfied with how I used them in this project. I feel there is room for improvement, even if I'm not exactly sure where.

Improving HTML Structure
I know I need to improve my HTML structure. I should use the correct semantic HTML elements and learn when to use each one. I also need to study meta elements further.

Enhancing CSS Skills
My CSS skills are improving, but I believe I can do more. For example, I plan to use the :root pseudo-class more effectively to manage my CSS variables.
